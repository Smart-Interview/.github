# Smart Interview: AI-Powered Recruitment Platform

### Project Overview

**Smart Interview** is an AI-driven recruitment platform designed to automate and streamline the candidate evaluation process. The platform integrates large language models (LLMs) to generate advanced multiple-choice (QCM) questions based on job descriptions, enabling accurate skill assessments. Additionally, it automates the analysis and matching of CVs with job offers using natural language processing (NLP). **Smart Interview** simplifies recruitment, making it more efficient and scalable.

The platform is composed of four key services, each handling a specific aspect of the recruitment workflow. Together, these services provide a seamless and intelligent hiring experience for both recruiters and candidates.

   A modern and intuitive user interface built with **Next.js**, providing easy access for recruiters and candidates. Recruiters can manage job offers and review applications, while candidates can apply for jobs and complete skill-based tests.

3. **Matching Service**:  
   This service leverages NLP to extract and analyze key information from candidate CVs. It calculates the similarity between a CV and a job description, helping recruiters identify the best-matched candidates quickly and efficiently.

4. **Question Generator Service**:  
   This service utilizes LLMs to generate customized QCM questions based on job descriptions. It ensures that the questions are tailored to assess the relevant skills and qualifications required for the job, providing an accurate evaluation of candidates.
